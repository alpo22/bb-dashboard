## About

A simple dashboard for BinBooker showing each Users order totals for last 30 days. It can help identify any users are flaking out and need to be reached out to.

### Stack:

- Vite
- React
- PHP

### Running:

Go here: http://binbooker.test/dashboard/

### Building:

```
npm run build
```

This will build the app and copy to the local web server.

### Deploying:

This app runs locally; it does not deploy anywhere.

### Local development:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

It's not expected to ever really do this since it is already working.
